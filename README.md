# GridBot

The task was to program the controller to a robot. Itâ€™s a simple robot that can
walk around in a room where the floor is represented as a number of fields in a
wire mesh. Input is first two numbers, which tells the robot how big the room is:

5 7

Which means that the room is 5 fields wide and is 7 fields deep.

The size of the room follows two digits and one letter indicating the starting
position of the robot and its orientation in space. For example:

3 3 N

Which means that the robot is in field (3, 3) and faces north. Subsequently, the
robot receives a number of navigation commands in the form of characters. The
following commands shall be implemented:

- L Turn left
- R Turn right
- F Walk forward

After the last command is received, the robot must report which field it is in
and what direction it is facing.

### Example:

5 5
1 2 N
RFRFFRFRF
Report: 1 3 N

5 5
0 0 E
RFLFFLRF
Report: 3 1 E
